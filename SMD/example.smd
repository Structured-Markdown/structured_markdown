    # Hello, everyone!
    Welcome to my templating engine thingy.
    This is essentially **heirarchal markdown**.
    I'm planning to call ~~Formatted~~ Structured Markdown, or something.

    Anyway, I'm just seeing how effective it is by writing it out like this.
    (Oh, this should be a new paragraph, btw.)

    ## This is a section header
    That's cool.

    layer side note:
        Woah, this is a side note.
        **why are you paying attention to it?**

    Well, that's about all I have to say...
    There are still `some` kinks to work out, I plan to add the ability to style and stuff.
    (And make the html it returns have proper formatting.)
    Bye!
